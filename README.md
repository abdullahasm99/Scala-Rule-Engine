# Scala-Rule-Engine
This project implements a rules engine in Scala for processing transaction data and applying discounts based on predefined rules. The rules engine reads transaction data from a CSV file, applies various discount rules based on product expiry, product type, quantity purchased, and special dates, and then calculates the final price and stores in DB.
